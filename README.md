# Time-Series-Analysis-Modelling
Final-Project: AIR QUALITY PREDICTION (Beijing pm2.5)


Air Quality is the most concerning topic in day-to-day life thatâ€™s when science dealing with
technology has helped to understand the dynamics of it quite better. Such data is mainly related
to Time Series domain. This project focusses on prediction of Air Quality for Beijing for the
year 2010-2014. Different time series methods and models have been implemented using
Python to forecast the prediction and all the associated functions are been developed in python.
Since the data is complex hence during the EDA pre-processing step the data is been subset for
the further analysis then it goes through the various steps of time series decomposition, singular
value decomposition for feature selection, model building and analysis and then summarizing
the performance metrics of the methods used to find the best model for the data.
